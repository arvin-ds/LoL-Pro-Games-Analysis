# LoL-Pro-Games-Analysis
## Summary
In this project, I use [OracleElixir's League of Legends Pro game data](https://oracleselixir.com/) for 2020 to analyze the statistics of winning and losing teams. I choose certain end-game datapoints as features (listed below) that I normalize, correlate, and model to predict team victory. 

The library I use in this is sklearn - this is my first project in Machine Learning and I am beyond excited about venturing into this feild.

## Features
I chose these features beginning with the word 'first'. These are all in-game objectives that are thought to correlate highly with victory.
